### What I will do with data 
1.	I will first have a bar graph to show the distribution of happiness score. I will then know distribution of happiness score, is it left-skew, right-skew or normal distribution
2.	Give a table of top 10 highest score of happiness country and top 10 lowest score of happiness country to see whether bias exist
3.	Make a box plot of happiness score by each region, we can easily compare highest, lowest and median by each region. 
4.	Find the correlation strengths between variables and happiness score and print them out
5.	Plot the variable with maximum correlation to happiness score vs the happiness score to get a visual on how correlated they are
6.	Combine two variables to see whether the correlation become stronger or not
7.	Setting up linear model to predict happiness

### what is my expecation
1.	The 10 highest happiness score countries
2.	The 10 lowest happiness score countries
3.	The distribution of happiness score
4.	I expect to see which variable is most correlated with happiness score and which variable is least correlated with happiness score
5.	I expect to see the plot that show the correlation between variables 
6.	I expect to see is there any combination of variables could make stronger correlation
7.	I expect the linear model could predict happiness core

### Importantce

  As a human centered data scientist, I think it is important to explore the factors could affect happiness index. There most important reason for this exploration is the happiness index can reflect the happiness of the country and higher the happiness is, more happiness the country is. There are couple reasons why happiness is important to human.

  First, happiness means fun, easy and feels good help human to achieve their goal.  This is a crucial reason why happiness is important for human. We all want to live easier and feels good all the time. The fundamental reason why happiness is very import for human beings is that it not only important to our personal goals in life but also can help us to achieve many other wonderful ambitions and goals. And also, being happy we could also change many other life, we could influence the people around us. 

  Second, more happiness means human can live longer and have better health. Many studies shown that happy people live longer. We all know that there is a link between stress and illness, as is the reverse. Positive feeling can change the chemical which make up of our bodies, produce benign chemicals that enhance our immunity system, cell repair, and body building strength. Happiness is the natural enemy of stress. Thus, more happiness can help human live longer and have better health. 

  Third more happiness could reduce the crime and violent rate, and in some extent can stop the war. Recent studies reveal an important reason why happiness is so important to all human beings. As we become happier, we become better people for society. It is because as human become happier they become more compassionate, more creative, more energetic, more emotionally and physically healthy. It is possible that there would have a huge reduction in incidents of violent and crime if we could raise the happiness index.

  Thus, we can see how important happiness for human being. More happiness is not only can help us achieve our personal goals but also can help us build a better world without violence and war. As a human centered data scientist, it is my duty to explore the underline principles that can affect happiness.
