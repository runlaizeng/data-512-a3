### What I will do with data 
1.	I will first have a bar graph to show the distribution of happiness score. I will then know distribution of happiness score, is it left-skew, right-skew or normal distribution
2.	Give a table of top 10 highest score of happiness country and top 10 lowest score of happiness country to see whether bias exist
3.	Make a box plot of happiness score by each region, we can easily compare highest, lowest and median by each region. 
4.	Find the correlation strengths between variables and happiness score and print them out
5.	Plot the variable with maximum correlation to happiness score vs the happiness score to get a visual on how correlated they are
6.	Combine two variables to see whether the correlation become stronger or not
7.	Setting up linear model to predict happiness
